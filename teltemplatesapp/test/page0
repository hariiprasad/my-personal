[{"id":37,"title":"Manchester United tackles poor form in earnings outlook","type":"youtube","content":"

Manchester United has forecast that annual revenue would fall for the first time in five years after its failure to qualify for this season's UEFA Champions League, but backed manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to rebuild the English football team.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward called for patience after the 20-time English champions also forecast a drop in core profit for 2019-20, saying the club was building for long-term success.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Returning to the roots of our club's ethos of youth-led attacking football is the right way forward," Woodward said on a post-results media call on Tuesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

United's history is sprinkled with squads built around young talent, most notably under Matt Busby in the 1950s and 1960s and under Alex Ferguson, whose class of 1992 included the likes of David Beckham and Ryan Giggs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The team endured a turbulent season in 2018-19 that prompted the departure of manager Jose Mourinho. The club finished sixth in the domestic league under former United striker Solskjaer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We and the fans demand success and that means winning trophies. That standard has never changed for Manchester United," Woodward said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"It is important we are patient while Ole and the team build for the future."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The club, which will play in the less lucrative Europa League this season, has made a stuttering start to the new English Premier League campaign and sits eighth in the table after six matches.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Despite a couple of big-money signings to bolster its defence - most notably the signing of English centre-half Harry Maguire, the most expensive defender in history - the club has been forced to rely more heavily on its youth system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

United had seven academy graduates in the squad during Sunday's 2-0 defeat against West Ham United.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
Six years, no titles<\/h2>\r\n\r\n

Woodward, a former investment banker who advised the Glazer family from the United States on its takeover of United in 2005, said the club is reviewing its structure amid increasing calls for the appointment of a technical director to oversee player recruitment and contract negotiations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Woodward has come under fire as several big-money signings and a trio of managers have underperformed since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, the last time United won the league title.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The club, which has suffered a more-than-seven-percent drop in its share price this year, also stands to lose ground to European rivals off the field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Spanish giant FC Barcelona last week reported 990 million euros ($1.1bn) in turnover for 2018-19 and expects to surpass one billion euros this year, while domestic rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are also breathing down United's neck.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Everyone at the club, the board, the manager, the squad and all the staff remain resolute in our desire to get Manchester United back to the top of English football," Woodward said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Revenue for United's 2019-20 financial year was forecast at between 560 million and 580 million pounds ($699m - $723m), down from 2018-19's record 627.1 million pounds ($783m) reported on Tuesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The club said Kantar data showed its global fan base had increased to 1.1 billion followers and that it expects 2019-20 core profit of 155 million to 165 million pounds ($193m to $206m) down from 186 million pounds ($232m) last year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

For the fourth quarter to June 30, revenue rose 8.1 percent to 131.4 million pounds ($163.5m), while adjusted core profit edged up 2.8 percent to 10.9 million pounds ($13.6m).<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The company's New York-listed shares were down 2.6 percent at $16.79 in early trading on Tuesday.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":48,"views":1997,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/6949ed1983953a7ad3e437c12d71b6f0.jpeg","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XOmtB0d0AR8","created":"10 months ago","tags":null,"shares":400},{"id":36,"title":"Flight shaming: 'Greta effect' is slowing down air travel","type":"video","content":"

One in five Western travellers is flying less, as "flight shaming" propels people to shun air travel for the sake of the planet - according to a survey of 6,000 Americans and Europeans by Swiss bank UBS.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The survey predicted environmental concerns would keep denting air traffic, as activists such as Sweden's Greta Thunberg lead the way and turn people off planes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Emma Kemp, 25, a campaigner and fundraising manager at United Kingdom climate change charity 10:10, said she skipped flying for her last tourist trip to Italy and Croatia and opted to get around by bus, train and ferry instead.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"I felt I was really travelling," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "And I felt at peace with myself, having done something for the planet."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

If these trends continue, the expected growth in passenger numbers could be halved, UBS said in a report published this week.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

UBS's July-August survey showed that, on average, about 20 percent of travellers in the United States, France, Germany and the UK had cut air travel by at least one flight in the past year because of concerns about climate change.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Commercial flying accounts for about two percent of global carbon emissions and about 12 percent of transport emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group, an aviation industry group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The survey also found that the percentage of people thinking of reducing their flying for the same reason had climbed to 27 percent, up from 20 percent in a previous survey during May 2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"With the pace of the climate change debate, we think it is fair to assume that these trends are likely to continue in developed markets," wrote UBS analyst Celine Fornaro.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

UBS said it expects the number of flights in the European Union will increase by just 1.5 percent per year, which is half the rate predicted by plane manufacturer Airbus.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Any cut in air travel will hit air manufacturers hard, with new plane orders at risk if travellers increasingly turn to trains and boats to take trips with a cleaner conscience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
'Elephant in the room'<\/h2>\r\n\r\n

In August, 16-year-old Thunberg - an icon for young environmental protesters - crossed the Atlantic in a racing yacht with no shower or toilet to join protests in the US and take part in the United Nations Climate Action Summit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Thunberg said the voyage cut her own carbon footprint and "sends a signal to other people around you that the climate crisis is a real thing".<\/p>\r\n\r\n

<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Her country, Sweden, has led a movement that rests on the idea that travelling on kerosene-guzzling jets is shameful.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It was also responsible for the Swedish concept of "flygskam"- exported as "flight shaming" in English and trending as "avihonte" on French social media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Scandinavian airline SAS has seen passenger traffic shrink two percent this year, while Sweden's airport operator said it handled nine percent fewer passengers for domestic flights this year than in 2018. Both have blamed "flight shame".<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Companies such as Klarna Bank AB are cutting back on business flights. The Swedish bank has banned all employee air travel within Europe and discourages long-haul flights.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The anti-flying movement - which emerged in 2017 after singer Staffan Lindberg pledged to give up flying - has now spread well beyond its native Sweden.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Germany has announced plans to cut taxes for train journeys and boost fees for flights. And as world leaders met in New York City for the UN Climate Action Summit last month, delegates were quick to quiz each other on how they travelled as "flight shame" reached peak attention.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"If there's an elephant in the room ... of course it's aviation," Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen told the summit.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":15,"views":1215,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/dee26d3d14b89d98799fd1a01e2f4586.jpeg","original":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/mp4\/67f0f73bb53e4745a20ed2c1566234ff.mp4","created":"10 months ago","tags":null,"shares":189},{"id":35,"title":"Hong Kong protesters rally against ban on wearing masks","type":"post","content":"

Hong Kong, China<\/strong> - Thousands of protesters have flooded Hong Kong's city centre and several neighbourhoods to express their opposition to a new ban on wearing masks during demonstrations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

By invoking the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam bypassed the territory's independent legislature to put the ban into effect on Friday after midnight.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

This was Lam's latest move in a desperate bid to deter violent clashes between police and demonstrators who are often masked.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"As a responsible government, we have a duty to use all available means," Lam said. "The decision to invoke the ordinance a difficult, but also necessary, one for public interest."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The ban is subject to vetting by the legislature when it reconvenes in less than two weeks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
'Backed into a corner'<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n

The news of the ban brought crowds of demonstrators to the central business district, plunging it into a virtual lockdown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Riot police unleashed tear gas to disperse the crowds, and by early on Friday evening, the area was deserted with haphazard roadblocks made of railings and rubbish bins littered about.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"The problem isn't about masking or not," said Calvin Chan, a 20-year-old demonstrator, donning a surgical mask. <\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Rather, the problem is with how Carrie Lam responds to our demands with such heavy-handed tactics," he added, alongside a friend of his also wearing a mask. "You can see she's got so few cards, and she's backed into a corner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

 <\/p>\r\n\r\n

Hong Kong moves to ban face masks as protests continue (08:47)<\/p>\r\n\r\n

 <\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Escalating the violence is the only answer to this authoritarian regime." <\/p>\r\n\r\n

Over the past four months, Hong Kong has been engulfed in anti-government protests triggered by a now-shelved bill that would have allowed the extradition of accused individuals to mainland China for trial.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The unrest has since been fueled by officials' refusal to address protesters' demands for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in suppressing the protests, blanket amnesty for all those charged with offences stemming from participating in demonstrations, and a retraction of police claims that protesters are guilty of rioting - a charge that carries a heavy prison sentence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

And the drawn-out campaign has since culminated into a pro-democracy movement, with protesters agitating for the right to directly elect their top leader and all the legislators.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Eric TM Cheung, principal lecturer of University of Hong Kong's faculty of law, said Lam's move "is setting a very bad precedent" as critics denounced the ban as one step down the slippery slope of eroding the rule of law.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"What we're facing now isn't a legal problem but a political problem. With this, the government essentially declared to the world that Hong Kong is no longer beholden to legal procedures," Cheung said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" framework, which guarantees Hong Kong people rights and freedoms under an independent judiciary.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Even as Lam invoked the ordinance, last used in 1967 during a months-long riot, she said: "We're not proclaiming Hong Kong is entering a state of emergency."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The ordinance gives Lam sweeping powers to legalise internment, suspend due process, block the internet and censor the media, among other things.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
Judicial review<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n

Meanwhile, the High Court heard a challenge on Friday night to the ban in the form of a judicial review.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Anyone who violates the ban can face one year in prison and a $3,200 fine, but questions remain on just how the ban can be effectively enforced.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Ever since the 2003 outbreak of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the surgical mask has become a daily necessity among many of the cleanliness-minded locals who wear it habitually.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Enforcement aside, some feared that the ban signalled that the worst is yet to come.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"The biggest challenge is to one of Hong Kong's core values, the rule of law," said Willy Lam, long-time commentator on Chinese politics and senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Al Jazeera.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"The protesters are becoming more defiant every week, and the police have now been now given new powers to arrest more people," Lam said. "This will make the confrontation bloodier, and worse."<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":28,"views":1251,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/89660c7c3e4cc155bae8c5141021bd41.jpeg","created":"10 months ago","tags":"Hong Kong,masks,china","shares":316},{"id":34,"title":"Moroccan journalist receives one-year prison sentence for 'illegal abortion'","type":"youtube","content":"

Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni was sentenced in a Rabat court Monday to one year in jail for having had an “illegal abortion” and sexual relations outside marriage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Her gynaecologist was given two years and her Sudanese fiance one year in prison, while an anaesthetist was handed a one-year suspended sentence and a medical assistant eight months, also suspended.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Lawyers for 28-year-old Raissouni had called for her acquittal during the trial, denying she had had an abortion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“This trial had no foundation – the accusations were baseless,” said defence lawyer Abdelmoula El Marouri after the verdict.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A journalist for Akhbar Al-Yaoum – an Arabic-language newspaper which has a history of run-ins with the authorities – Raissouni was sentenced under Article 490 of the legal code of the Muslim kingdom.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

That article punishes sexual relations out of wedlock, while the law also forbids all abortions unless the mother’s life is in danger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Meriem Moulay Rachid, lawyer for the convicted gynaecologist, said: “The judicial system has had its word, (but) we will appeal.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Relatives of Raissouni also told AFP that they would appeal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Raissouni had appeared serene when arriving at the courtroom, wearing a black veil covering her head.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

She waved to her relatives before taking her place in the dock.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

‘Political trial’<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Raissouni was arrested on August 31 as she left a clinic in Rabat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In court, she denied having had an abortion and said she had been treated for internal bleeding – testimony backed up by her gynaecologist.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The journalist denounced a “political trial”, saying she had been questioned by police about her family – including an uncle who is an outspoken Islamist newspaper columnist – and about her own writing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The prosecution insisted she had been seen by a medic and showed signs of pregnancy and of having undergone a “late voluntary abortion”.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It had contended her detention had “nothing to do with her profession as a journalist”.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The reporter herself said she had been “forced into a medical examination without her consent”.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Unfortunately, for the past two decades, a lot of journalists have been prosecuted for charges that are unrelated to their reporting," freelance journalist Aida Alami told FRANCE 24. "It's become a pattern whenever a journalist bothers the state too much – a case comes up, they're found guilty and it kind of neutralizes their ability to be critical."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Raissouni's lawyers said that medical examination was a “humiliation tantamount to torture”, while they also pointed to “judicial police failures” and “fabricated evidence”.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The case has caused a storm in Morocco, creating debate on personal freedoms in the North African state and on the treatment of critical figures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It has also received significant attention far beyond the country’s borders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Reporters Without Borders say Raissouni’s treatment amounted to “meddling in the private lives of journalists and the use of personal information” with the intent of defamation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Between 600 and 800 back-shop abortions occur each day in Morocco, according to estimates by campaign groups.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In a manifesto published on September 23 by various Moroccan media outlets, hundreds of women declared themselves “outlaws” by claiming to have already violated the “obsolete” laws of their country on abortion and other social norms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In the early 1970s, in a similar text, French women calling themselves the “343 sluts” famously declared they had had an abortion when it was still illegal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Last year, Morocco tried thousands of people for sex out of wedlock, 170 people for being gay and 73 for pregnancy terminations.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":7,"views":644,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/e4909f801c44e5a6cd6e979ded114049.jpeg","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?time_continue=1&v=u2fITY8HQfQ","created":"10 months ago","tags":"MOROCCO,ABORTION,FREEDOM,PRESS","shares":58},{"id":33,"title":"Tunisian court rules that presidential candidate Nabil Karoui must stay in jail","type":"video","content":"

Tunisian presidential candidate Nabil Karoui, who faces an election run-off this month, must stay in detention for now on suspicion of financial crimes that he denies, a court ruled on Tuesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The television mogul was arrested in August on 3-year-old charges of tax evasion and money laundering, but came second in the first round of the presidential election last month.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It has raised difficult questions for Tunisia’s young democracy, with his supporters saying he is the victim of political chicanery and his critics saying his campaign is based on the illicit use of his media channel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Tunisia has been a democracy since 2011, when its people rose up in a revolution that ousted veteran autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and inspired the “Arab Spring” uprisings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The electoral commission has said Karoui can compete in the Oct. 13 run-off against retired law professor Kais Said unless he is convicted, though there seems little chance of an imminent verdict.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Said and Karoui’s success in beating established political leaders including the prime minister, two former premiers and a former president, was seen as a sharp rebuke to Tunisia’s ruling elite after years of economic discontent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The electoral commission has warned that Karoui’s detention may violate his right to a fair hearing with voters, putting it at odds with Tunisia’s judiciary, which has repeatedly ruled that he must stay behind bars.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

If he wins election, it is unclear if he could be sworn into office in prison instead of the parliament chamber, or if the immunity the constitution gives presidents would apply to crimes not yet tried in court.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A constitutional court mandated by the 2014 constitution which would normally adjudicate complex political questions has not yet been formed. The last parliament was unable to agree on which judges it should contain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Tunisia’s president has direct control over foreign and defence policy but can also obstruct legislation passed by the government and parliament.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A parliamentary election, in which Karoui’s Heart of Tunisia party is running, will take place on Sunday. The biggest party in parliament can shape the choice of prime minister and the formation of a government.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Thinking of flashing your new Rolex on Instagram? Better make sure you’ve paid your taxes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The French government is considering allowing authorities to monitor the social media accounts of French taxpayers to root out possible fraud. In addition to watching what people flaunt on sites such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, authorities will keep an eye on purchases on sites such as eBay and the French equivalent, Le Bon Coin.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The French parliament is set to debate a proposal to allow the tax office’s computer system to collect information from social media networks for a trial period of three years. The aim is to identify people whose lifestyles, as evidenced by their postings on social media, are incongruous with their declared incomes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“(The fiscal administration) will be able to see that if you have numerous pictures of yourself with a luxury car while you don’t have the means to own one, then maybe your cousin or your girlfriend has lent it to you, or maybe not,” Darmanin told French business TV show Capital last year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The system would be able to determine a person’s primary residence and potentially detect customs fraud on online sales sites, the Guardian reported. It would rely on information that is freely accessible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The proposal, Darmanin’s brainchild, has caused concern for the country’s data protection watchdog group, the National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties (CNIL). If enacted, it could infringe on freedom of thought and expression, according to a warning the CNIL issued on September 12 that was made public on September 30.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The government must provide “strong guarantees” and “rigorous evaluation,” the CNIL cautioned, adding that the massive collection of data could have a significant impact on people’s personal lives. The worry is that data could be mined automatically rather than gathered in a targeted manner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Tax evasion cost the French government an estimated €80 billion to €100 billion in 2017, up from €60 to 80 billion in 2013, according to Solidaires Finances Publiques, the largest union representing France’s tax authorities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed Donald Trump a major victory, upholding his travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries and rejecting claims that it amounted to discrimination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The 5-4 ruling, with the court’s five conservatives in the majority, ended a fierce fight in the courts over whether the policy amounted to an unlawful Muslim ban.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump quickly claimed “profound vindication” after lower courts had blocked his travel ban announced in September, as well as two prior versions, in legal challenges brought by the state of Hawaii and others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The court held that the challengers had failed to show that the ban violates either U.S. immigration law or the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring one religion over another.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump, who has called the travel ban necessary to protect the country against attacks by Islamic militants, reacted on Twitter, writing: “Wow!”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In a statement issued by the White House, Trump labeled the ruling “a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution” that upheld presidential authority on national security issues.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country,” Trump said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said that Trump’s administration “has set forth a sufficient national security justification” to prevail. “We express no view on the soundness of the policy,” Roberts added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The ruling affirmed broad presidential discretion over who is allowed to enter the United States. It means that the current ban can remain in effect and that Trump could potentially add more countries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The current ban, announced in September, prohibits entry into the United States of most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The Supreme Court allowed it to go largely into effect in December while the legal challenge continued.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Roberts said the actions taken by Trump to suspend entry of certain classes of people were “well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other president - the only question is evaluating the actions of this particular president in promulgating an otherwise valid proclamation.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The challengers have argued the policy was motivated by Trump’s enmity toward Muslims and urged courts to take into account his inflammatory comments during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump as a candidate called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In a strident dissent that she read from in court, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said there were “stark parallels” with the court’s now discredited 1944 decision that upheld U.S. internment of Japanese-Americans during World War Two. Sotomayor described at length various statements Trump made on the campaign trail.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Taking all the evidence together, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was driven primarily by anti-Muslim animus,” Sotomayor added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

As part of Tuesday’s ruling, Roberts officially repudiated the 1944 internment ruling and he rejected the comparison, saying that the war-era practice was “objectively unlawful and outside the scope of presidential authority.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Roberts said it was “wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facial neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The travel ban was one of Trump’s signature hardline immigration policies that have been a central part of his presidency and “America First” approach. Trump issued his first version just a week after taking office, though it was quickly halted by the courts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Chad initially was on the list of countries targeted by Trump that was announced in September, but he removed it on April 10. Iraq and Sudan were on earlier versions of the ban. Venezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the current policy. Those restrictions were not challenged in court.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

‘Go down in history’<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Civil rights groups and Democrats denounced the ruling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“The ruling will go down in history as one of the Supreme Court’s great failures,” said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the ban.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The court’s decision “swallows wholesale government lawyers’ flimsy national security excuse for the ban instead of taking seriously the president’s own explanation for his actions,” Jadwat added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Not since key decisions on slavery, segregation in schools, and Japanese American incarceration have we seen a decision that so clearly fails to protect those most vulnerable to government-led discrimination,” added Farhana Khera, executive director of the group Muslim Advocates.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Despite today’s ruling, turning away those fleeing horrific violence and persecution or to discriminate against people based on nationality and religion continues to be as un-American as ever,” said Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump also has moved to rescind protections for young immigrants sometimes called Dreamers brought into the United States illegally as children, acted against states and cities that protect illegal immigrants, ended protected status for certain immigrants in the country for decades, intensified deportation efforts and pursued limits on legal immigration.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump last week retreated on his administration’s practice of separating the children of immigrants from their parents when families were detained illegally entering the United States.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The high court in June and December 2017 allowed two versions of the ban to take effect while court challenges ran their course but had not resolved the legal merits of the challenges until now.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

His lawyers said that only Trump’s actions since he became president in January 2017 should be relevant to the case. During the April 25 arguments before the justices, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said it was “crystal clear” that the travel restrictions were not a manifestation of Trump’s call for a Muslim ban.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":10,"views":493,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/f00a854ee25d0cdf03eddaef6d8999e0.jpeg","created":"10 months ago","tags":"TRAVEL,TRUMP,SUPREME,COURT","shares":63},{"id":29,"title":"Malaria can be eradicated within a generation: global health experts","type":"post","content":"

President Donald Trump announced this week that all e-cigarette flavours apart from tobacco will be removed from the US market. But the popularity of vaping continues to grow globally, with the UK and France among the biggest users in Europe.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

After a sixth confirmed death and more than 450 cases of respiratory problems connected to e-cigarettes reported across the United States, Washington has stated its intention to take action by banning the flavours that appear designed to appeal to young people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid – which typically contains nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin, flavourings and other chemicals – into an aerosol that the user inhales. No single device or substance has been linked to all the US deaths or lung problems. But in 80 percent of the cases, people admitted they were smoking a cannabis oil that e-cigarettes are not designed to vapourise. It also appears that many bought their devices on the black market instead of from official retailers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

American anti-tobacco groups applauded Trump’s announcement but said the restrictions must be “immediate”.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“It has taken far too long to stop e-cigarettes companies from targeting our nation’s kids with sweet-flavored, nicotine-loaded products,” said Matthew Myers, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

 <\/p>\r\n\r\n

 <\/p>\r\n\r\n

The former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has pledged $160 million to combat the rise of vaping. But the popularity of the cigarette alternatives continues to rise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Growing e-cigarette markets in Europe<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

France has one of the largest e-cigarette markets in Europe, with over 1.2 million “vapoteurs” partaking every day. Sales are growing at a rate of 5-10 percent every year and is already valued at €350 million.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

But what are the real risks of e-cigarettes? “This is the big question. We are still investigating the long-term effects of vaping,” said addiction and smoking expert Dr. Philippe Arvers of SOS Addictions in comments to FRANCE 24.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“What we do have concrete evidence for is the real and positive role e-cigarettes play in giving up smoking for so many people in France.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

French support for vaping appears to be growing. Instead of restricting e-cigarettes, France continues to encourage vaping as a means of fighting tobacco addiction. According to an Odoxa-Dentsu Consulting survey conducted in 2018, for more than two-thirds of those surveyed, the e-cigarette is indeed an aid to smoking cessation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A 2019 report by France’s Economic, Social and Environmental Council on tobacco and alcohol addiction highlights a significant drop in smoking rates in recent months but stops short of drawing a specific link with vaping.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The report also advised excluding tobacco lobbyists from discussions about vaping.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

What is vaping?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Vaping has been around since 2003, when a Chinese pharmacist, Hon Lik, is credited with creating the first vapourising e-cigarette. Its purpose was to wean a smoker off traditional tobacco-filled cigarettes without forcing them to go cold turkey.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

E-cigarettes promise a healthier alternative to cigarettes as they do not contain tobacco and provide a lower level of nicotine. They also provide smokers with something physical to hold in their hands as they wean themselves off the cigarette habit. There is no known link between vaping and cancer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

While the long-term health effects remain unknown, some say governments should make an effort to prevent e-cigarette use by young people merely due to their nicotine content. Nicotine can harm developing brains, the development of which continues until at least the age of 25. When children expose their brains to nicotine they become vulnerable to addiction, may have trouble paying attention, and can experience mood disorders and reduced impulse control.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Smoking culture<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Smoking has long been more tolerated in France than on the other side of the Atlantic. But changing attitudes and public pressure led to a 2006 ban on smoking in enclosed public places such as restaurants, bars, government buildings and schools.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In May 2013, then health minister Marisol Touraine announced that the ban would be extended to include e-cigarettes. She also banned their purchase by minors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Touraine’s Article 28 prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in certain public spaces, including educational establishments and establishments intended for the reception, training and accommodation of minors; in closed public transport (bus, train, metro, tramway...); and inside enclosed or covered workplaces that are used by more than just one individual.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In principle, it is not forbidden to vape in other places open to the public (restaurants and bars, for example). However, establishments are free to implement a ban on their premises.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump’s proposed ban specifically focuses on the appeal of e-cigarettes to young people. In America, e-cigarette use by teenagers increased by 78 percent in the year from 2017 to 2018. And, according to a 2014 survey, 81 percent of young e-cigarette users cited the availability of appealing flavours as a primary reason for use. Fruity flavours mask the bitterness of nicotine, making it a lot more palatable for younger smokers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“We do not have the research on how many young people start with e-cigarettes and then progress to cigarettes,” says Arvers. “But in France, the numbers show that between 2016 and 2018 the number of smokers had hugely diminished, both for men and women. More than 1 million people gave up smoking. This is very significant.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The most recent figures in France show that there were 17 million smokers in 2018 compared to 18 million in 2017 (of a total population of 66 million).<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Arvers believes that any risks from vaping are manageable given the well-known health hazards of cigarettes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Vaping is not completely risk-free but the risks are much much smaller than with cigarettes,” he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“We know that one smoker out of every two will die from cigarette use. We cannot ignore this figure. Our main drive has to be towards a new generation of non-smokers. And we believe that e-cigarettes serve a crucial purpose in getting us towards this goal.”<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":13,"views":589,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/27ed25f4947b70b628d969c5213e40b1.jpeg","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KZDQ5jV83LM","created":"10 months ago","tags":"trump,smoking,health","shares":68},{"id":27,"title":"FIFA orders Cardiff to pay Nantes €6m in Emiliano Sala transfer-fee dispute","type":"post","content":"

Cardiff City must pay French club Nantes an initial six million euros ($6.5 million) in their dispute over the payment of the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala, FIFA said on Monday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The amount corresponds to the first instalment of the 17 million-euro fee Cardiff had agreed to pay Nantes before Sala died in a plane crash on January 21 while travelling to join his new club.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Cardiff had previously resolved not to pay any of the money even though the transfer had been completed before the accident.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In relation to the remainder of the initially agreed fee, FIFA told AFP: “For confidentiality reasons, we cannot comment at this stage on potential future instalments or other conditions of the transfer agreement.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The announcement from world football’s governing body followed a meeting by its Players’ Status Committee.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In a statement, FIFA said it had “never lost sight of the specific and unique circumstances of this tragic situation during its deliberations on the dispute at stake.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Both clubs can appeal the decision to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport, although in a statement Nantes said they were “pleased with FIFA’s decision.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Cardiff must honour their commitments and the rule of the laws of sport,” the club’s lawyers wrote in a text message sent to AFP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“Above and beyond the human tragedy of Emiliano Sala’s death which touched everyone in the sport, FIFA have provided a reminder that the commitments made by clubs when they sign players obviously must be respected.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Nantes had previously appealed in February over Cardiff’s failure to pay the 17 million euros they said was owed because Sala had already signed for the Welsh side.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“The International Transfer Certificate, delivered by FIFA, established that, on the day of the accident, Emiliano was a Cardiff player,” Nantes added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A Cardiff spokesperson said the club “acknowledges the decision” but added that they “will be seeking further clarification from FIFA on the exact meaning of their statement in order to make an informed decision on our next steps.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The plane Sala was travelling on came down in the English Channel during a night-time flight.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

His body was recovered, but that of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A report by Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch in August said that Sala and the pilot were likely exposed to “potentially fatal” levels of carbon monoxide on the plane.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In the aftermath of the tragedy, Cardiff were relegated from the Premier League after just one season back in the top flight.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":13,"views":618,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/da2aad9e5f1f8a3a606a800fc81ac9fa.jpeg","created":"10 months ago","tags":"FOOTBALL,FIFA,EMILIANO,SALA","shares":70},{"id":26,"title":"Trump lashes out at Democrats over impeachment inquiry","type":"youtube","content":"

A bellicose Donald Trump unleashed furious attacks Wednesday on the impeachment inquiry launched against him by Democrats, amid an intensifying standoff between the president and Congress.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump -- accused of leaning on Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on one of his main 2020 election rivals -- resorted to coarse language in his broadsides against the investigation and his adversaries conducting it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Democrats should be "focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016," Trump tweeted.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Adam Schiff, the impeachment probe's Democratic point man in the House of Representatives, told reporters there is a "real sense of urgency" to press forward.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump has fought back in terms once inconceivable for a president, including his claim late Tuesday that this is "not an impeachment, it is a COUP."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

He amplified the message Wednesday standing alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in the White House, branding the impeachment process -- announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi<\/a> last week -- as a "hoax."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump assailed Schiff, declaring the House Intelligence Committee chairman "a low life" who should be arrested for "treason."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

But at the same time Trump acknowledged he may yet cooperate with the latest move by Democrats, who threatened to subpoena the White House for documents related to the president's efforts to get Ukraine to probe a political rival.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We'll work together with 'shifty' Schiff and Pelosi and all of them and we'll see what happens," he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump insists he did nothing wrong in a July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky and on Wednesday got support from Russia's President Vladimir Putin<\/a>, who said he saw "nothing compromising" in the conversation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Given Trump's controversial history with Putin, it was unlikely that the Kremlin leader's backing would do much to calm waters in Washington.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

'Not fooling around'<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

A White House summary of the call showed Trump pressed Zelensky several times to open a corruption investigation against leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and son Hunter, who did business in Ukraine when his father was vice president.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Neither Biden has been credibly accused of any wrongdoing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked," Trump said Wednesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump is alleged to have suggested that US military aid Ukraine sought to beef up its defenses against Russia would be contingent on him getting that favor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A whistleblower, so far only identified as someone from the intelligence services, went to authorities with concerns about the call, triggering the impeachment inquiry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Trump has likened the whistleblower to a spy and called for his or her identity to be made public, although by law whistleblowers are protected.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Schiff on Wednesday called Trump's comments about the whistleblower a "blatant effort to intimidate witnesses."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

He also warned Trump and the White House to treat the pending subpoena with the utmost gravity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We're not fooling around here," Schiff said, adding that efforts to stonewall the collection of related data would be considered "evidence of obstruction of justice."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Meanwhile, the State Department's independent watchdog met with a bipartisan group of staffers from House and Senate committees to discuss new wrinkles in the scandal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Inspector General Steve Linick showed staff, and some lawmakers who attended, documents sent mysteriously to State that included a rehash of conspiracy theories that appeared aimed at discrediting Trump's opponents.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"These documents provide further evidence of a concerted, external effort to conduct a disinformation campaign against a career US ambassador, who has been the subject of baseless attacks, including by the President himself," said Senate Democrat Robert Menendez.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The State Department is closely caught up in the probe, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirming that he listened in during the Zelensky call.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

First testimony<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Pompeo and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have been subpoenaed to provide documents. Five diplomats have so far been summoned to testify.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Pompeo suggested that the committees could be forced to subpoena the five officials, and that State and the White House could seek to limit what they can talk about.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead," Pompeo said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, will testify Thursday and the ex-ambassador to Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, appears behind closed doors on October 11, according to Schiff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Volker was sought by Giuliani to help pressure Zelensky, while Yovanovitch was removed earlier this year as ambassador after she reportedly resisted that effort.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":3,"views":369,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/50f28e4fcb2eda89edf19aa4a5b1b0ea.jpeg","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O-cYGAhfp4k","created":"10 months ago","tags":"USA,IMPEACHMENT,DONALD,TRUMP,DEMOCRATS","shares":43},{"id":25,"title":"Placido Domingo withdraws from NY Met Opera","type":"post","content":"

The Metropolitan Opera announced Tuesday that Placido Domingo had agreed to withdraw from his slate of scheduled performances at the opera house following allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple women in two AP stories.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The opera legend indicated that he would never again perform at the Met.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Domingo had been scheduled to sing the title role in the season premiere of Verdi's "Macbeth" on Wednesday night, which would have been his first performance in the United States since the AP reported that numerous women had accused him of inappropriate behaviour, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The Met had been under increasing pressure to cancel Domingo's six scheduled appearances, but general manager Peter Gelb reiterated to performers after a dress rehearsal Saturday that the opera house was awaiting results of investigations by the LA Opera, where Domingo has been general director since 2003, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union that represents various opera staff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Domingo, who had sung in rehearsals, issued a statement saying his Met career was over after what the company said was 706 performances as a singer, plus 169 as a conductor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"I made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera<\/a> at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theater for 51 consecutive, glorious years," the star said. "While I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection, I believe that my appearance in this production of 'Macbeth' would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both on stage and behind the scenes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"As a result, I have asked to withdraw," he added, "and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request. I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of 'Macbeth,' which I consider my last performance on the Met stage."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In its statement, the Met said the long-married, Spanish-born superstar had "agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Gelb sent an email to the Met staff saying, "We are grateful to him for recognizing that he needed to step down."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera previously cancelled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published. But his reception has been far different in Europe, where he received lengthy ovations after concert performances of Verdi's "Luisa Miller" at the Salzburg Festival in Austria on Aug. 25 and 31, just weeks after the initial AP story.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

One of Domingo's accusers, Patricia Wulf, called Domingo's withdrawal from the Met "such a relief."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"I feel like we accomplished something," said Wulf, who accused Domingo of repeatedly harassing her during performances at Washington Opera in the late 1990s, while he was general director of the company.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"The Met finally stepped up and did the right thing<\/a>," she told the AP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

In addition to announcing Domingo's withdrawal, Gelb said the Met was suspending tenor Vittorio Grigolo pending the outcome of an investigation opened Tuesday by The Royal Opera in London, which said he was alleged to be involved in a Sept. 18 incident when he sang the title role in Gounod's "Faust" on tour in Tokyo.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Grigolo, 42, was scheduled to sing six performances of Alfredo in Verdi's "La Traviata" at the Met in February and March. He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The Met fired conductor James Levine in March 2018 after an investigation by a law firm retained by the company found evidence of sexual abuse and harassment. Levine, the company's music director from 1976-2006, was music director emeritus at the time and denied the allegations. He filed a breach of contract and defamation lawsuit that was settled last month.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Domingo made his Met debut in September 1968 and is known to many beyond opera for his performances as part of The Three Tenors with Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras. Singing far beyond the retirement age of most singers, he shifted to baritone parts in 2009, extending his repertoire to more than 150 roles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Domingo's next scheduled performance is in Verdi's "Nabucco" at the Zurich Opera on Oct. 13. He is not slated to sing in the U.S. until Donizetti's "Roberto Devereux" at the LA Opera, which opens Feb. 22.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Zeljko Lucic will replace him for the Mets' three performances of "Macbeth." Domingo also had been scheduled for four performances as Sharpless in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" at the Met in November.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Before Domingo's withdrawal, the New York state senator whose district includes the opera house called for Domingo's removal from performances.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"I believe they have an obligation to hold their performers to a high standard, given the fact that they are one of the world's most important cultural institutions," said Brad Hoylman, a Democrat. "They should be thinking also not just about his celebrity and star power, but about the 20 women who allegedly have made complaints. The Met has an obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees and I'm concerned that if they don't take action on this, this matter might discourage future employees from coming forward."<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":5,"views":301,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/08e6cf055b5d40516fe24243417c18f1.jpeg","created":"10 months ago","tags":"opera,metoo,sexual harassment","shares":44},{"id":24,"title":"Mali declares three days of national mourning after deadly raids on military","type":"video","content":"

Malian troops backed by foreign allies on Wednesday launched a hunt for scores of soldiers listed as missing after one of the deadliest attacks in a seven-year-old jihadist insurgency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

At least 25 troops were killed after militants aboard heavily-armed vehicles raided two military camps at Boulkessy and Mondoro near the border with Burkina Faso, according to a provisional toll.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Fifteen jihadists were killed in the raids, according to government figures, which began early Monday and were quelled more than a day later.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Around 60 soldiers were listed as missing -- 78, according to a security source -- but late Wednesday the Malian army said 11 had returned to their base.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It is unknown whether the others have been killed or captured.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Operations to secure the area are under way with Mali's partners," a Malian military source said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"Our objective is to consolidate our presence in Boulkessy and to focus on soldiers of whom we are currently without news."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita declared three days of national mourning would begin on Thursday, according to a government statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Hundreds of angry youths and wives of soldiers demonstrated outside a military camp in the capital Bamako late Wednesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Some demonstrators burned tyres to block off the avenue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We came here because the government is not telling the truth about the number of dead," a woman demonstrator told AFP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"It's our husbands, the red berets, who are at Boulkessy."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"My father is a soldier, he's at Boulkessy, and I haven't any news of him," said 15-year-old Ali Oumar Diakite. "They're lying to us. The army is under-equipped."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A blow to Mali's armed forces<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

The losses are a crushing blow to Mali's armed forces, which are flailing in the face of a jihadist revolt that has spread from the arid north to its centre, an ethnically mixed and volatile region.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The operation is also a humiliation for the so-called G5 Sahel force -- a much-trumpeted initiative under which five countries decided to create a joint 5,000-man anti-terror force -- and for France, which is committed to shoring up the fragile region.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The losses symbolise "the escalating activities of violent extremist groups (in the Sahel) with more and more ambitious targets," said Baba Dakono of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), a think tank based in Senegal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The attacks were eventually subdued with the help of Malian special forces and foreign allies, including French warplanes and helicopters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The jihadists made off with a large quantity of arms, ammunition and equipment -- local media stated about 20 vehicles were captured, including some mounted with machine-guns.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

But French Defence Minister Florence Parly hailed the Malian army for quickly dispatching units to regain control of the camps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"The determination of these units has helped restore a delicate and compromised situation and inflict losses on terrorists," she said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

According to an army report seen by AFP, two army helicopters and about a dozen vehicles were burned in the attack on Boulkessy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The camp there -- which housed a Malian battalion that was part of the G5 Sahel -- was destroyed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The G5 Sahel secretariat said the assailants were members of Ansarul Islam, a jihadist group accused of multiple attacks in northern Burkina Faso.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Other sources were unable to confirm this.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Fragile centre<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n

Jihadists lost control of northern Mali after French military intervention, but regrouped to carry out hit-and-run raids and roadmine attacks -- classic tactics by a mobile guerrilla force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

They have also moved on to the country's central region, where they have inflamed long-standing resentments between ethnic groups, analysts say.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

On March 17, the Malian army lost nearly 30 men in an attack on a camp in Dioura, also in the troubled central region.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

That assault came on the heels of a massacre of 160 Fulani (also called Peul) villagers -- a bloodbath that led to a military reshuffle and the government's resignation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

UN chief Antonio Guterres has been pounding the drum for help for Sahel states, among the poorest in the world, in their struggle against the mobile, well-armed and ruthless jihadists.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

On September 14, the West African regional group ECOWAS announced a billion-dollar plan to help fund the military operations of the nations involved.

French police officers are going on strike for the first time in nearly 20 years on Wednesday, taking to the streets of Paris for an “anger march” against low morale, rising suicides and the Macron government’s controversial pension reforms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Ahead of the first police strike in France since 2001, union leaders are hoping to mobilise 15,000 to 20,000 demonstrators in response to morale-sapping accusations of violence against Yellow Vest protesters, a wave of suicides among officers and proposed pension reforms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“There is a deep sense of despair,” David Le Bars, secretary-general of the SCPN-Unsa police union, told AFP. “All of the unions know that the police are sick with worry.”<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Police officers who have served at least 27 years benefit from a bonus pension contribution every five years. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner – who earned the nickname “France’s No. 1 cop” for his unfaltering defence of police conduct during the Yellow Vest crisis – insisted on September 17 that he would fight “until the end” for this special provision for the police.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

However, “Castaner doesn’t have all the cards in his hand; he’s playing a game of poker with the president and prime minister, who control the purse strings,” Yves Lefebre, secretary-general of the Unité-SG-FO union, told AFP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

“We’re already thinking about what action we will take after October 2,” he continued.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":5,"views":548,"user":"Julian Zelizer","trusted":false,"userid":1,"userimage":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/140926165927-julian-e-zelizer-profile-image-small-11.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/6b9fa024cea2437500db3502e30cdcf4.jpeg","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U1WphWkCyMI","created":"10 months ago","tags":"FRANCE,POLICE,STRIKE,UNIONS","shares":48},{"id":21,"title":"Iraq police open fire to disperse protesters in Baghdad","type":"post","content":"

Protesters defy curfew to gather in Baghdad after 20 killed and hundreds injured across the country since Tuesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

At least 20 people have been killed across Iraq as widespread anti-government protests enter the third day, with hundreds more injured.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

An indefinite curfew has been imposed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and several southern cities after the Iraqi prime minister convened his national security council for an emergency meeting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"All vehicles and individuals are totally forbidden to move in Baghdad as of 5am today, Thursday, and until further notice," Adel Abdul Mahdi said in a statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Travellers to and from Baghdad airport, ambulances, government employees in hospitals, electricity and water departments, and religious pilgrims are exempt from the curfew, the statement said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Demonstrations over similar issues engulfed the southern city of Basra last summer and effectively ended previous premier Haider al-Abadi's chances of a second term.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Abdul Mahdi now faces a similar challenge just weeks before his government marks a full year in power.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
'Frustrated, angry youth'<\/h2>\r\n\r\n

Early Thursday, some cars and civilians were seen in the capital's streets. Speaking two kilometres from Tahrir Square, the focal point of protests, Al Jazeera's Imran Khan said there was an"eerie quiet over Baghdad" but that he could hear "sporadic gunfire towards Tahrir Square".<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"What we are hearing from protesters themselves is that come 3 pm local time (1200  GMT) they will try and push towards Tahrir Square," Khan said. "So the scene is being set between the protesters and the Iraqi security forces."<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Residents are wary that more protests could erupt after powerful Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr called for "a general strike".<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Al-Sadr's political bloc, Saeroon, which came first in last May's parliamentary elections, is part of the ruling coalition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The demonstrations have descended into violence as security forces responded to protesters by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"There was no spark for these protests," Khan said. After a small protest was quickly dispersed by security forces on Tuesday, a social media call went out which resulted in thousands of people taking to the streets, he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The protesters are mostly "angy young people who are not aligned to any political or religious party", Khan said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"They are simply very frustrated at the fact that they don't have jobs," he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Meanwhile, two border crossings to Iraq - including one widely used by Iranian pilgrims - have been closed because of unrest in Iraq, Iranian border guards said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

According to Iran's semi-official news agency Mehr, Iranian border guards commander General Qasem Rezaei said the Khosravi and Chazabeh crossings had been closed since late Wednesday, but other crossings were open ahead of an annual Shia Muslim pilgrimage in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
Defying curfew<\/h2>\r\n\r\n

On Thursday morning, riot police fired into the air to disperse hundreds of protesters who had gathered at Tahrir Square in central Baghdad - in defiance of the curfew - to protest against high unemployment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We slept here so the police don't take the place," one demonstrator told AFP news agency before being pushed back by the police.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Since erupting in Baghdad on Tuesday, the protests have spread to other cities in the country's south, posing a challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's one-year-old government.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Curfews were also imposed in the holy city of Najaf on Wednesday after security forces fired on protesters who are demanding an end to rampant power cuts, water shortages and state corruption.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

Anger over staggering rates of youth unemployment, which is around 25 percent or double the adult rate according to the World Bank, appears to have set off the latest round of demonstrations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

"We want jobs and better public services. We've been demanding them for years and the government has never responded," said Abdallah Walid, a 27-year-old protester.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The southern city of Nasriya, which has seen so far the deadliest protests with a total of eight protesters and one police officer killed, has also been placed under curfew. <\/p>\r\n\r\n

Another protester was shot dead on Thursday in the province of Dhi Qar, regional health chief Abdulhussein al-Jaberi said. <\/p>\r\n\r\n

In the city of Amarah, medics and security forces have confirmed the killing of four protesters on Thursday, bringing the death toll over the past three days to 20.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

More than 400 others have been wounded in the nationwide protests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n
Green Zone explosion<\/h2>\r\n\r\n

The tension has been exacerbated by a near-total internet shutdown, the closure of government offices and at least one overnight explosion that hit the Green Zone, where some ministries and embassies are located.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

A security source inside the area told AFP there were two blasts, likely caused by indirect fire a little over a week after two rockets hit near the US embassy there.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The apparent attack came hours after security forces sealed off the Green Zone "until further notice", fearing angry protesters would swarm state buildings or foreign missions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

The Green Zone had been inaccessible for most Iraqis since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq but had reopened to the public in June.<\/p>\r\n\r\n

It has often been the focal point for public anger, including in 2016 when al-Sadr's supporters stormed it and paralysed state institutions.<\/p>","review":false,"comment":true,"comments":14,"views":682,"user":"Amine Rami","trusted":true,"userid":3,"userimage":"https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/220453\/pexels-photo-220453.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500","thumbnail":"http:\/\/news.virmana.com\/uploads\/cache\/post_thumb_api\/uploads\/jpeg\/fb54fe6b65444c3238fc5cfff667ee7e.jpeg","created":"10 months ago","tags":null,"shares":100}]
